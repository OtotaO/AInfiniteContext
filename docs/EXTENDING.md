# Extending InfiniteContext

InfiniteContext is designed to be highly extensible, allowing you to customize and extend its functionality to meet your specific needs. This document explains how to extend the system with custom components.

## Custom Storage Providers

One of the most common ways to extend InfiniteContext is by adding custom storage providers. This allows you to integrate with different storage systems, such as cloud storage services, databases, or specialized storage solutions.

### Implementing a Custom Storage Provider

To create a custom storage provider, you need to implement the `StorageProvider` interface. See the full documentation for details.

### Registering a Custom Storage Provider

Once you've implemented your custom storage provider, you can register it with the MemoryManager:

```typescript
import { InfiniteContext } from 'infinite-context';
import { CustomStorageProvider } from './CustomStorageProvider';

const context = new InfiniteContext();
await context.initialize();

// Create and connect your custom storage provider
const customProvider = new CustomStorageProvider('custom', 'Custom Storage');
await customProvider.connect();

// Add the provider to the memory manager
context.memoryManager.addStorageProvider(customProvider);
```

## Custom Vector Stores

The default vector store implementation in InfiniteContext is a simple in-memory store. For larger datasets or more advanced search capabilities, you might want to implement a custom vector store.

### Implementing a Custom Vector Store

To create a custom vector store, you can extend the `VectorStore` class or implement a compatible interface. See the full documentation for details.

### Using a Custom Vector Store with Buckets

To use your custom vector store with buckets, you can pass it to the bucket constructor:

```typescript
import { Bucket, BucketConfig } from 'infinite-context';
import { CustomVectorStore } from './CustomVectorStore';

const bucketConfig: BucketConfig = {
  id: 'custom-bucket',
  name: 'Custom Bucket',
  domain: 'custom',
  description: 'A bucket with a custom vector store'
};

const vectorStore = new CustomVectorStore(1536, 'cosine');
const bucket = new Bucket(bucketConfig, vectorStore);
```

## Custom Embedding Functions

InfiniteContext uses embeddings to represent chunks of text in a high-dimensional space. By default, it uses OpenAI's embedding models, but you can provide your own embedding function.

### Implementing a Custom Embedding Function

An embedding function is simply a function that takes a string and returns a vector (array of numbers). See the full documentation for details.

### Using a Custom Embedding Function

To use your custom embedding function, pass it to the InfiniteContext constructor:

```typescript
import { InfiniteContext } from 'infinite-context';
import { customEmbedding } from './customEmbedding';

const context = new InfiniteContext({
  embeddingFunction: customEmbedding
});

await context.initialize();
```

## Custom Summarization

InfiniteContext includes a summarization engine that generates summaries of text at different levels of detail. You can customize this by providing your own summarization logic.

### Implementing a Custom Summarization Engine

To create a custom summarization engine, you can extend the `SummarizationEngine` class or implement a compatible interface. See the full documentation for details.

## Custom Memory Monitoring

InfiniteContext includes a memory monitoring system that tracks usage across buckets and storage providers. You can customize this by providing your own monitoring logic.

### Implementing a Custom Memory Monitor

To create a custom memory monitor, you can extend the `MemoryMonitor` class or implement a compatible interface. See the full documentation for details.

## Custom Error Handling

InfiniteContext includes a robust error handling system that provides detailed error information and recovery mechanisms. You can customize this by providing your own error handling logic.

## Custom Transaction Management

InfiniteContext includes a transaction management system that ensures data consistency during complex operations. You can customize this by providing your own transaction management logic.

## Custom Data Integrity

InfiniteContext includes a data integrity verification system that detects and repairs data corruption. You can customize this by providing your own data integrity verification logic.

## Custom Backup Management

InfiniteContext includes a backup management system that creates and restores backups of stored data. You can customize this by providing your own backup management logic.

## Custom Data Portability

InfiniteContext includes a data portability system that exports and imports data in various formats. You can customize this by providing your own data portability logic.

## Custom Vector Index Optimization

InfiniteContext includes a vector index optimization system that improves search performance. You can customize this by providing your own vector index optimization logic.
